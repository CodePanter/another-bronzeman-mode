# Another Bronzeman Mode RuneLite Plugin
This plugin implements the custom gamemode called 'Bronzeman mode'.
The idea of this gamemode lies somewhere between a 'normal' account and an 'Ironman' account; as you can't buy an item on the Grand Exchange until you have obtained that item through other means, such as getting it as a drop or buying it in a shop.

The plugin enforces this rule by keeping track of all items you acquire, and only allowing you to buy this item.
When the plugin is enabled for the first time it will unlock all items in your inventory, as well as unlock all items in your bank the next time you open it.

## Features

- Restricts buying items from the Grand Exchange until that item is obtained through self-sufficient methods.
- Shows an item unlock graphic every time you obtain an item for the first time.
- Unlocks are handled per account so you can have multiple bronze-men or not effect the status of your bronze-man accounts.
- Can optionally take screenshots of all new item unlocks.
- Supports adding a list of names of other Bronzeman accounts, and will provide them with (client side) Bronzeman chat icons.

This player has only unlocked bronze arrows, so the other items are greyed out and not clickable.
